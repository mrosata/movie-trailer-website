# (Udacity) Movie Trailer Website

What this program will do:

 * Show Videos, movies and tvshows in Pinterest style grid
 * Allow user to view youtube trailer on movies (not tvshows)
 * Allow filtering of videos by type, title, and star rating on imdb.com


### Requirements
This application requires python 2.7 and the Flask package. It has been tested in Chrome only. If you have virtualenv, that would great as well. To install flask and start the webserver, just follow the steps below.

```sh
# Execute these 2 commands and then open `chrome` to http://127.0.0.1:5000 or http://localhost:5000
$ pip install flask
$ python main.py
